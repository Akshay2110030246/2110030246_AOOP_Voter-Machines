Today, only about 1 percent of the population votes at polling places on hand counted paper ballots, but this figure is misleading. 
There are many elections conducted on optical mark-sense ballots that are actually hand counted, and many jurisdictions that use lever voting machines process absentee ballots by hand.
Hand-counting of mark-sense ballots is common in small local elections where a small turnout is expected and there are only a few issues on the ballot. 
When this is the case, the cost of hand counting may well be less than the cost of programming and testing the vote tabulating machinery.

Aside from hand counted paper ballots and lever voting machines, all of today's voting technologies rest on the use of computers, and two suggestions follow quite naturally from this: First, why should these computers operate in isolation? Why not interconnect them using some kind of network technology, and second, why not let me use my own computer to vote instead of making me use a publically owned machine in a polling place.
It is also helpful for handicapped people where they can vote from online.
